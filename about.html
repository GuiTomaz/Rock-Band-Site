            <p>System of a Down (also known abbreviated as SoaD or just simply as System) is an Armenian-American
                heavy metal band formed in Glendale, California, in 1994. It currently consists of members Serj Tankian
                (lead vocals, keyboards), Daron Malakian (guitar, vocals), Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals), and
                John Dolmayan (drums), who replaced original drummer Andy Khachaturian in 1997</p>

            <p>The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted at
                number one on the US Billboard 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards and their
                song "B.Y.O.B." won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2006. The band went on hiatus in
                2006 and reunited in 2010, and they have continued to perform live occasionally since then. Other than
                two new songs in 2020 ("Protect the Land" and "Genocidal Humanoidz"),[2] System of a Down has not
                released a full-length record since the Mezmerize and Hypnotize albums in 2005. The band has sold over
                40 million records worldwide, while two of their singles "Aerials" and "Hypnotize" reached number one
                on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.</p>
